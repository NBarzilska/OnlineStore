This project is showing my learning process during which I am developing JS, HTML and CSS at once.
Here is a list with the features that I included in the project:
- Using Bootstrap framework in building the grid in order to 
- Adding an auto-scrolling slider at the bottom of the page about store data
- Adding a text field to search for the product and to work while entering text in this field so that the list of products is being filtered according to the search string
- Implementing a dynamic pagination for the product list which updates without reloading the page and recalculated when the number of products changes during filtering

I am also working on developing the project by doing the following steps:
- Adding active href links in the html file that lead to other pages
- Developing better CSS styles
- Making a webpage stretch (or shrink) according to screen/window/device size
